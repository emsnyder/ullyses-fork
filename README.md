# ULLYSES

This repo contains the codes used to create the high level science products (HLSPs) for the targets in the Hubble Space Telescopeâ€™s (HST) Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program. See more info about ULLYSES and its targets at [ullyses.stsci.edu](https://ullyses.stsci.edu).

A full description of the data products produced by the ULLYSES team can be found at [ULLYSES Data Products](https://ullyses.stsci.edu/ullyses-data-description.html). 

## Installation

The `ullyses` package can be installed into a virtualenv or conda environment via `pip`. We recommend that for each installation you start by creating a fresh environment that only has Python installed and then install the `ullyses` package and its dependencies into that bare environment. If using conda environments, first make sure you have a recent version of Anaconda or Miniconda installed.

The first two steps are to create and activate an environment:

    conda create -n <env_name> python=3.8
    conda activate <env_name>
   
Python version 3.8 or greater is required for some dependencies, including `calcos`, the COS data calibration pipeline used in these scripts.

To install your own copy of the code into that environment, you first need to fork and clone the `ullyses` repo:

    cd <where you want to put the repo>
    git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/ullyses
    cd ullyses
    
*Note: `python setup.py install` and `python setup.py develop` commands do not work.*

Install from your local checked-out copy:

    pip install .

If you anticipate making edits to any of the ULLYSES scripts, it may be more useful to 
install from your local checked-out copy as an "editable" install:

    pip install -e .

All package dependencies will be installed simultaneously, including `ullyses-utils`, which can be found at https://github.com/spacetelescope/ullyses-utils.

## Creating HLSPs

Individual HLSPs for a single target can be created by putting all of the input
files into one directory.  The input files are _x1d.fits files for COS and STIS,
and _vo.fits for FUSE.  You can create all the HLSPs for this target by running
the wrapper script, which can be done from the command line.  For convenience,
it is recommended to create an environment variable pointing to the location
of the wrapper script:

    export ubin=/path/to/github/checkout/ullyses

Then invoke the script from the directory containing the files to be processed:

    cd /directory/containing/data/files/
    python $ubin/wrapper.py -o './products'

Alternatively, the script can be run from a directory that doesn't contain the data
to be processed by using the ``-i /directory/containing/data/`` option:

    python $ubin/wrapper.py -o /directory/to/put/products -i /directory/containing/input/data

## Creating custom-calibrated individual spectra
Prior to turning spectra into ULLYSES HLSPs, some targets require extra processing to
fix various calibration issues. For example, STIS/G750L data need to be defringed, and 
wavelength offsets due to miscentering in the aperture need to be corrected. Once these custom
calibration steps have been applied, a keyword is added to the output FITS file signifying
that the file should be considered a level0 HLSP- that is, a custom-calibrated *individual*
1D spectrum. The various level0 products, and how to create them, are described below.

### Custom-calibrated STIS spectra
All T Tauri star STIS CCD observations, and a subset of STIS NUV- and FUV-MAMA observations,
require tailored calibrations. Special calibration steps can include: 
custom hot pixel identification and flagging, defringing for G750L observations, and 
customized spectral extraction parameters for T Tauri stars and their companions.

To create a custom-calibrated STIS spectra, you must supply a configuration YAML file.
The ULLYSES team has already examined each T Tauri star and recorded the optimal 
custom calibration parameters in YAML files stored in the 
[ullyses-utils](https://github.com/spacetelescope/ullyses-utils/tree/main/utils/data/stis_configs) 
repository. You may use the ULLYSES YAML files as input, or supply your own, but it must
conform to the 
[format outlined here](https://github.com/spacetelescope/ullyses-utils/blob/main/utils/data/stis_configs/target_grating.yaml).

Once you have a YAML file, you create the custom-calibrated STIS spectrum like so:
```
python calibrate_stis_data.py -i <indir> -y <yaml> -o <outdir>
```

where `<indir>` is the input directory that houses the data you wish to calibrate,
`<yaml>` is the name of the yaml file, and `<outdir>` is the output directory
where products, logs, and diagnostic plots will be written. A log file of the format
`YYYYMMDD_HHmm_cal.log` will be written, unless otherwise specified using the optional
arguments below.

Optional arguments are:
```
  -c, --clobber                     If True, overwrite existing products
  --nolog                           If True, do not produce log file
  -l LOGFILE, --logfile LOGFILE
                                    Alternative name of output log file
```

**TODO:** add info about coadding blended spectra.

### Wavelength-shifted COS spectra
If a target is not perfectly centered in the COS aperture, the wavelength array can be
offset from its true values. Wavelength offsets can be easily corrected by recalibrating
the data and supplying a shift file to CalCOS, as described in the 
[COS Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-5-cos-data-analysis/5-3-working-with-extracted-spectra#id-5.3WorkingwithExtractedSpectra-5.3.2RedoingSpectralExtraction).

The ULLYSES team has identified stars which require such wavelength offset corrections and 
documented the necessary shifts in text files stored in the 
[ullyses-utils](https://github.com/spacetelescope/ullyses-utils/tree/main/utils/data/cos_shifts) 
repository.

Once you have a shift file, you can create wavelength-shifted COS spectra by supplying on
a directory with multiple exposures, or by supplying on a single file. You can easily 
create wavelength-shifted COS spectra using the pre-defined ULLYSES shift files like so:
```
python apply_cos_shifts.py <infiledir> <outdir> 
```
where `<infiledir>` is the input filename or directory of files that should be shifted,
and `<outdir>` is the directory to write shifted 1D spectra.
In this case, the target name in the input file(s) header(s) **_must_** match the target name
in the shift file. If for some reason it does not, you must also supply the target name 
as it appears in the shift file using an additional `-t <targ>` argument.

You may also create wavelength-shifted COS spectra using your own custom shift file, which
is done like so:

```
python apply_cos_shifts.py <infiledir> <outdir> -s <shift_file>
```
where `<shift_file>` is the name of your custom shift file. 

Other optional arguments are:
```
  --copydir COPYDIR     Name of directory to copy shifted products to
    -c, --overwrite       If True, overwrite existing products
```

### Custom-flagged FUSE spectra
The ULLYSES team uses FUSE 
[VO (Virtual Observatory)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PASP..119..527D/abstract) 
files with minimal modification. A DQ (Data Quality) array is added to each VO file, as is
required by the ULLYSES pipeline. For the majority of FUSE targets, this DQ array is 
uniformly zero, meaning there are no data quality issues. However, for a handful
of targets, custom flagging is imposed in order to screen out bad spectral regions. 
Possible DQ flags include: 
* DQ=1 (region was affected by the worm) 
* DQ=2 (poor photometric quality) 

To create these custom-flagged FUSE spectra:
**Still need to fill this in**
