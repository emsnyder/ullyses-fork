    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hubble Space Telescope’s (HST) Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards ([ULLYSES](https://ullyses.stsci.edu/index.html) program will devote approximately 1,000 HST orbits to the production of an ultraviolet spectroscopic library of young high- and low-mass stars in the local universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Director’s Discretionary program has been designed to take advantage of HST’s unique UV capabilities, as both high- and low-mass stars feature different complex UV emission processes that strongly impact their surroundings, but are difficult to model. The UV emission from star formation is central to a wide range of vital astrophysical issues, ranging from cosmic reionization to the formation of planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ULLYSES program will uniformly sample the fundamental astrophysical parameter space for each mass regime — including spectral type, luminosity class, and metallicity for massive OB stars (in the Magellanic Clouds and two other lower-metallicity nearby galaxies) and the mass, age, and disk accretion rate for low-mass T Tauri stars (in eight young Galactic associations). The data were gathered over a three-year period, from Cycle 27 through Cycle 29 (2020-2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The design and targets of these observations were determined in partnership with the astronomical community, allowing researchers from around the world to help develop the final program and to plan coordinated observations with other space- and ground-based telescopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ULLYSES team produces several types of High Level Science Products (HLSPs), which we will walk through in this notebook. Products are made using both archival data and new HST observations obtained through the ULLYSES program. Data products are available from the [ULLYSES website](https://ullyses.stsci.edu/ullyses-download.html) (HLSPs and contributing data), the [MAST Data Discovery Portal](https://mast.stsci.edu/) (HLSPs and contributing data), or directly as a High-Level Science Product collection using the [DOI](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/ullyses) (HLSPs only)."
